Todo :
Create functionality to check availability of a particular bike on a particular date.
Create functionality to book a bike on a particular date and time. (Intervals)

Adding Complexity to the API :
Real world scenario when we have a particular bike with n numbers and each bike is different, we may have multiple
each bike can be differentiated using the license plate, 

Bikes

bike_id, license_plateno, brand, engine we can create two tables | Although we can use license_plate_no as a primary but 
it is not ideal for performance as it is a string 
it is a candidate key which itself can be referred by primary key so it is safe to assume that bike_id as primary key
will not turn our table into 2NF

A bike can be uniquely identified by licesnse_plate_no and bike_id

Some kind of security to our api, token based, session
Adding salt to our passwords


Why do we need a cache ?
 - Since our application is going to be read heavy we can use some caching for storing values that are accessed frequently.
